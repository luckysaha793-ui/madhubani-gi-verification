    <h2>Part 1: Must-Know Basic Concepts</h2>
    <p><strong>Geographical Indication (G.I.)</strong> is a form of Intellectual Property Right that protects goods which originate from a specific geographical location and possess qualities, reputation, or characteristics essentially attributable to that place of origin. Unlike other IPRs, G.I.s are deeply connected with history, culture, and community knowledge.</p>

    <p>In India, Geographical Indications are governed by the <strong>Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999</strong>. The Act provides for registration, protection, administration of the G.I. Registry, and enforcement mechanisms. The Registrar exercises powers similar to a civil court in matters relating to registration, opposition, and rectification.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration of G.I.</strong> is governed by Section 11 of the Act. Applications are filed by associations of persons, producers, or statutory authorities representing the interests of producers.</p>

    <p>An <strong>Authorised User</strong> is a person officially permitted by the registered proprietor of a G.I. to use the indication on goods produced by them. Misuse or misconduct may result in cancellation of authorised user registration.</p>
